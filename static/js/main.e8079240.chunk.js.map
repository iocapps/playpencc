She started PlayPen with the\n        goal of offering a structured education to children who attend day care, ensuring that they are provided with\n           ample opportunities in order to reach age-appropriate social, emotional and physical milestones.</p>\n      </Card>\n      <Card className=\"info mission\">\n        <h2 className=\"headings\">Mission</h2>\n        <p>We believe that children should be provided with the optimal nurturing in order to facilitate physical, mental,\n        social and emotional growth.
